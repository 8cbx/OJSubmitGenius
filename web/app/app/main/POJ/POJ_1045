-Description:-
Consider the AC circuit below. We will assume that the circuit is in steady-state. Thus, the voltage at nodes 1 and 2 are given by v
1
= V
S
cos
w
t and v
2
= V
R
cos (
w
t +
q
) where V
S
is the voltage of the source,
w
is the frequency (in radians per second), and t is time. V
R
is the magnitude of the voltage drop across the resistor, and
q
is its phase.<img src="http://poj.org/images/1045/bode.jpg"/>

You are to write a program to determine V
R
for different values of
w
. You will need two laws of electricity to solve this problem. The first is Ohm's Law, which states v
2
= iR where i is the current in the circuit, oriented clockwise. The second is i = C d/dt (v
1
-v
2
) which relates the current to the voltage on either side of the capacitor. "d/dt"indicates the derivative with respect to t.
-Input:-
The input will consist of one or more lines. The first line contains three real numbers and a non-negative integer. The real numbers are V
S
, R, and C, in that order. The integer, n, is the number of test cases. The following n lines of the input will have one real number per line. Each of these numbers is the angular frequency,
w
.
-Output:-
For each angular frequency in the input you are to output its corresponding V
R
on a single line. Each V
R
value output should be rounded to three digits after the decimal point.
